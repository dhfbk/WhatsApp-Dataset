# WhatsApp-Dataset
We developed this WhatsApp dataset to study cyberbullying among Italian students aged 12-13 in the context of the [CREEP EIT project](http://creep-project.eu/).
The corpus of Whatsapp chats is made of 14,600 tokens divided in 10 chats. All the chats have been annotated by two annotators using the [CAT web-based tool](https://dh.fbk.eu/resources/cat-content-annotation-tool) following the same guidelines. 
Our guidelines are an adaptation to Italian of the “Guidelines for the Fine-Grained Analysis of Cyberbullying” developed for English by the Language and Translation Technology Team of Ghent University. With respect to the original guidelines, we added a new type of insult called "Body Shame" to cover expressions that criticize someone based on the shape, size, or appearance of his/her body. We have also changed the original type "Encouragement to the Harasser" into "Encouragement to the Harassment", so to include all the incitements between the bully and his/her assistants.
